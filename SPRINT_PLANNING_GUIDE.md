# Sprint Planning & Team Composition Guide

## Overview

The enhanced Jira sync system now includes powerful sprint planning and team composition analysis features. These tools help you:

- **Calculate sprint estimates** based on story points and team velocity
- **Compare different team compositions** and their impact on timeline
- **Analyze project risk profiles** to make informed decisions
- **Generate recommendations** for optimal team sizing and project approach

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Demo the Features

```bash
python demo_sprint_planning.py
```

### 2. Interactive Planning Tool

```bash
python sprint_planner.py
```

### 3. Include in Regular Sync

```bash
python enhanced_jira_sync.py
```

The enhanced sync will automatically add a "Sprint Planning" sheet to your spec sheet.

## üìä Core Concepts

### Team Velocity

- **Base velocity**: Story points a team member can complete per sprint
- **FTE adjustment**: Velocity multiplied by Full Time Equivalent (0.0-1.0)
- **Sprint overhead**: 15% reduction for meetings, planning, and interruptions
- **Team velocity**: Sum of all effective member velocities

### Default Team Compositions

#### Small Team (2.5 FTE)

- 1x Senior Developer (1.0 FTE, 8 SP/sprint)
- 1x Junior Developer (1.0 FTE, 5 SP/sprint)
- 1x Designer (0.5 FTE, 6 SP/sprint)
- **Total velocity**: ~16 SP/sprint

#### Medium Team (5.5 FTE)

- 1x Tech Lead (1.0 FTE, 10 SP/sprint)
- 2x Senior Developer (2.0 FTE, 8 SP/sprint each)
- 1x Junior Developer (1.0 FTE, 5 SP/sprint)
- 1x Designer (1.0 FTE, 6 SP/sprint)
- 1x QA Engineer (0.5 FTE, 4 SP/sprint)
- **Total velocity**: ~34 SP/sprint

#### Large Team (10.5 FTE)

- 1x Tech Lead (1.0 FTE, 10 SP/sprint)
- 3x Senior Developer (3.0 FTE, 8 SP/sprint each)
- 2x Mid Developer (2.0 FTE, 6 SP/sprint each)
- 2x Junior Developer (2.0 FTE, 5 SP/sprint each)
- 1x Designer (1.0 FTE, 6 SP/sprint)
- 1x QA Engineer (1.0 FTE, 4 SP/sprint)
- 1x DevOps Engineer (0.5 FTE, 7 SP/sprint)
- **Total velocity**: ~61 SP/sprint

### Velocity Benchmarks (Industry Standards)

| Role             | Story Points/Sprint | Notes                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Junior Developer | 3-5 SP              | Learning curve, simpler tasks |
| Mid Developer    | 5-7 SP              | Balanced experience           |
| Senior Developer | 7-10 SP             | Complex tasks, mentoring      |
| Tech Lead        | 8-12 SP             | Architecture, code review     |
| Designer (UI/UX) | 4-8 SP              | Depends on complexity         |
| QA Engineer      | 3-6 SP              | Testing, automation           |
| DevOps Engineer  | 5-8 SP              | Infrastructure, CI/CD         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### 1. Sprint Estimation

Calculates how many sprints a project will take based on:

- Total story points
- Team composition and velocity
- Sprint length (default: 2 weeks)
- Sprint overhead (default: 15%)

### 2. Team Comparison

Compare different team sizes and see the impact:

- **Timeline differences** (sprints, weeks, months)
- **Cost implications** (larger teams = higher cost but faster delivery)
- **Risk considerations** (team coordination overhead)

### 3. Custom Team Builder

Create custom teams by specifying:

- **Role** (e.g., "Senior React Developer")
- **FTE** (0.1 to 1.0 - percentage of time dedicated)
- **Velocity** (story points per sprint for this role)

### 4. Risk Analysis

Analyzes your project's risk distribution:

- **Proven work**: Fixed pricing, clear scope
- **Experimental work**: ¬±30% variance, shared risk
- **Dependent work**: Hourly billing, external dependencies

### 5. Intelligent Recommendations

Based on your project characteristics:

- Team size suggestions
- Timeline vs. cost trade-offs
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Project phase recommendations

## üîç Example Analysis Output

```
üìä Sprint Planning Analysis for 87 story points
============================================================

Small Team:
  Team Size: 2.5 FTE
  Velocity: 16.2 SP/sprint
  Duration: 6 sprints (12 weeks, 2.8 months)
  Team: 3 people

Medium Team:
  Team Size: 5.5 FTE
  Velocity: 34.0 SP/sprint
  Duration: 3 sprints (6 weeks, 1.4 months)
  Team: 5 people

Large Team:
  Team Size: 10.5 FTE
  Velocity: 61.2 SP/sprint
  Duration: 2 sprints (4 weeks, 0.9 months)
  Team: 7 people
```

## üí° Best Practices

### Team Sizing Guidelines

- **Small projects (<30 SP)**: 1-2 developers sufficient
- **Medium projects (30-100 SP)**: 3-5 person team recommended
- **Large projects (>100 SP)**: Consider 6+ person team or project phases

### Risk Management

- **High experimental work (>30%)**: Add prototyping phase
- **Significant dependencies (>20%)**: Ensure external readiness
- **High overall risk**: Larger team + buffer time

### Velocity Considerations

- New teams start at 70% of expected velocity
- Velocity stabilizes after 3-4 sprints
- Account for holidays, vacations, and training
- Consider team coordination overhead for large teams

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### `TeamMember`

Represents individual team members with role, FTE, and velocity.

#### `Team`

Manages team composition and calculates total velocity.

#### `EnhancedSpecSheetSync`

Main class with sprint planning methods:

- `calculate_sprint_estimates()`
- `compare_team_options()`
- `generate_sprint_planning_report()`
- `add_sprint_planning_sheet()`

### Calculation Methods

```python
# Sprint calculation
sprints_needed = math.ceil(total_story_points / team_velocity)
weeks_needed = sprints_needed * sprint_length_weeks
months_needed = weeks_needed / 4.33

# Team velocity calculation
team_velocity = sum(member.velocity * member.fte for member in team.members)
effective_velocity = team_velocity * (1 - sprint_overhead)
```

## üìä Excel Integration

The system automatically creates a "Sprint Planning" sheet with:

### Project Overview

- Total story points
- Number of epics
- Epic breakdown with story counts

### Team Comparison Table

- Team compositions
- Velocities and FTE
- Sprint/week/month estimates

### Risk Analysis

- Risk profile distribution
- Story count and point percentages
- Risk impact analysis

### Recommendations

- Data-driven suggestions
- Timeline optimization tips
- Risk mitigation strategies

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Default Teams

Edit the `_create_default_teams()` method in `enhanced_jira_sync.py`:

```python
def _create_default_teams(self):
    teams = {}

    # Your custom team
    custom_team = Team("My Team")
    custom_team.add_member(TeamMember("Senior Dev", 1.0, 9))
    custom_team.add_member(TeamMember("Junior Dev", 1.0, 4))
    teams["custom"] = custom_team

    return teams
```

### Adjusting Sprint Settings

Modify these class attributes:

- `sprint_length_weeks = 2` # Sprint duration
- `sprint_overhead = 0.15` # Overhead percentage
